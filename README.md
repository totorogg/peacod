# PEACOD

Database partitioning is a common technique adopted by database
systems running on single or multiple physical machines. It is always crucial
yet challenging for a DBA to choose an appropriate partitioning scheme for a
database according to a specific query workload. 

PEACOD is a tool that aims to ease the burden of DBAs for database partitioning
design. By automating the processing of database partitioning scheme evaluation
and comparison, PEACOD provides the DBAs with a conventional way to choose
a suitable scheme.

PEACOD can help the DBAs to more
efficiently choose the optimal partitioning scheme for a specific application scenario.
PEACOD only requires the users to provide the input dataset and workload, and indicate
the partitioning schemes that they intend to evaluate and compare. After that, PEACOD
will automatically derive the performance results of schemes in comparison and show
them to the users with illustrative figures of different forms. We have run PEACOD
on different scenarios using well-known benchmarks.
